Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Gained experience in working with CSS grid layout. Also I found the <span> / <div> type elements to group and seperate sentences to make them adaptable with the screen width resolution.
