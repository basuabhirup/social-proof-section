## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Gained experience in working with CSS grid layout. Also I used the html span elements to group and seperate sentences to make them adaptable with the screen width resolution.


```html
    <section class="ratings">
      <h4 class="rating1"> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ &nbsp; <span class="ratingText">Rated 5 Stars in Reviews</span></h4>
      <h4 class="rating2"> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ &nbsp; <span class="ratingText">Rated 5 Stars in Report Guru</span></h4>
      <h4 class="rating3"> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ &nbsp; <span class="ratingText">Rated 5 Stars in BestTech</span></h4>
    </section>
```
  
```css
.ratingText {
  display: inline-block;
  min-width: 100px;

```
